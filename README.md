# Australia's Top Artists

A little React app created for the purposes of gaining more experience in React and playing around with the React Router and the Digital Transformation Agency's UI-Kit.  The app pulls the current top 10 most played artists from Last.fm, displays them, and provides a means of drilling down to get more information about them (via another interaction with the Last.fm API).

## Some notes on the design
